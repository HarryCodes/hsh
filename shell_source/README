[CUSTOM FEATURES]

(*lenny-disclaimer* 'variable prompt' and 'lenny function' perform the same end result, but achieve the same functionality differently.
Having implemented lenny first and then variable prompt, I kept this feature because I like it.)
'lenny': Custom Builtin Command, lenny, is a reference to the internet phenomena; the lennyface.
A lennyface is composed of japanese characters and some ascii table characters,
lined up in succession to create the illusion of a single-lined-image of a face or thing,
similar to the concept of ASCII ART. An example of a lennyface is the default prompt that shows
up everytime you launch a new instance of my shell. In this case, the lennyface is the lenny doggo.
The purpose of 'lenny' is to provide the user with the ability to set a custom prompt using the builtin.
The general grammar of this command is `lenny "SomeText and MoreText"`.
It is just a fun little gimmick I wanted to try at and I encourage you to try it out!
